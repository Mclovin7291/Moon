	<p>The full moon is a lunar phase that occurs when the Moon is fully illuminated as seen from Earth. This happens when the Earth is positioned between the Sun and the Moon, causing the entire face of the Moon that is visible from Earth to be lit up by the Sun's rays. The full moon is a striking and iconic celestial event, often associated with various cultural, religious, and mythological beliefs. Its bright light can cast shadows and is known to influence nocturnal behavior in both humans and animals.</p>
	<p>Culturally, the full moon has held significant importance across civilizations. In many cultures, it is a symbol of fertility, harvest, and renewal. Festivals such as the Mid-Autumn Festival in China and the Harvest Moon Festival in Japan celebrate the full moon, often with rituals, dances, and offerings. In Western traditions, the full moon has been linked to folklore and myths, such as werewolves and lunacy, the latter stemming from the Latin word "luna," meaning moon, reflecting the belief that the full moon could influence mental states. </p>
	<p>From a scientific perspective, the full moon has a notable impact on natural phenomena. It influences ocean tides through its gravitational pull, leading to higher and lower tides, known as spring tides. Some studies suggest that the full moon may affect human sleep patterns, although the evidence is still inconclusive. Despite the myths and legends surrounding it, the full moon is a natural occurrence that continues to captivate and inspire curiosity, serving as a reminder of the intricate connections between the Earth, the Moon, and the broader cosmos.</p>
